# vtu_result
A script in python to download results from results.vtu.ac.in

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95FW7GKJgCo&t=4s

This script is very readable and understandable by anyone with decent pragramming knowledge
Chrome and Chromium web driver is a must to run
Firefox the default Ubuntu brower isn't supported by vtu.ac.in , hence i've used Chrome
I've used Splinter(Selenium for noobs) and Selenium itself for this script

7 seconds are given to enter captcha. If anyone knows any good and FREE automated captcha entering serbice please add it to the script

I have plans of saving the result into a CSV file instead of screenshots , that it currently does.

Please help me to extend this file , my pyhton knowledge is relatively weak
